## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks :
### Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML [Link](https://github.com/iamSharukhMulani/Internship-at-The-Spark-Foundation-/tree/main/Task%201%20Prediction%20using%20Supervised%20ML)

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

### Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML [Link](https://github.com/iamSharukhMulani/Internship-at-The-Spark-Foundation-/tree/main/Task%202%20Prediction%20using%20Unsupervised%20ML)

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters 
and represent it visually. 

### Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail [Link](https://github.com/iamSharukhMulani/Internship-at-The-Spark-Foundation-/tree/main/Task%203%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Retail)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. 

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

### Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm [Link](https://github.com/iamSharukhMulani/Internship-at-The-Spark-Foundation-/tree/main/Task%206%20Prediction%20using%20Decision%20Tree)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
